## Description
This project is a customer management system for a fictional business that sanitizes dustbins.

The program is responsible for managing customers details such as personal, contact and sanitizing details.  Comments may be added for customers for administration use. Additionally, payment-related features can be used such as viewing the customers' current balance, payments made by the customer, and generated invoices for the customer. Customer accounts may also be deactivated or activated.

The payment section allows for administration to record payments made by customers. The payments page handles duplicate payments, balance updating, payment reversal, and other validation.

The invoice section allows for administration to generate invoices for customers and holds many searching and filtering features to quickly find the customer or group of customers the user is looking for. Invoices may be generated in batch and also allows the user to tweak certain dates on the invoice such as issue, fee, and brought-forward dates. Lastly, invoices for customers may be downloaded in batch for selected months.

The settings page allows administration staff to change or set certain features such as adding or removing bank details to display on customer invoices.

The project makes use of programming languages such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, NodeJS and PHP. Additionally Bootstrap is used for styling.

#### keys.php
The `keys.php` file holds additional keys used in the site. The `$secretLoginToken` is used as the login token when accessing the token and you may set this to whatever you like.

The `$recaptchaKey` should be the secret key for your Google reCaptcha. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Uq3-ulW-k) how to setup your Google reCaptcha for the site. Please ensure to use reCaptcha v2 â€“ "I am not a Robot" Checkbox. **Note**: Unfortunately as of the current version there is no work around to the Google reCaptcha and I apologise for the inconvenience this may cause in testing the project.
